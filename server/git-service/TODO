- add content encoding
- add support for "dumb" clients
- add support for loose objects and other shit like that
- maybe dependency injection
- add timeout for handlers
- kind of easy to tell if 
    the backend is hashing the password for auth from the client side
    which means a private repo exists, so maybe fix that
